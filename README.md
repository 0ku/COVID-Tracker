# Covid Tracker
 
 Welcome!
 This project was done to practice working with both React Native and utilizing APIs. The API used for this project can be found here: https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193/
 
 The app allows the user to easily view and access information on countries with the highest active cases, lowest active cases, and most total cases. Alternatively, users can also choose to search for a country/continent directly. 
 
 This project allowed me to not only work with the API through Axios, but also allowed me to play around and experiment with useState for flashcards/displaying information, along with tab navigation.
